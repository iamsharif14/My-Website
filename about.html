          Hello! My name is <strong>Shariful Islam</strong> and I am a student
          at Seneca College. My student ID is <strong>106975246</strong>. I
          created this tourism website as part of my WEB222 assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve always been fascinated by ancient history and mythology, which is
          why I chose <em>Athens, Greece</em> as the focus of my project. The
          city’s cultural heritage, classical ruins, and rich historical
          background make it a dream travel destination for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope this site gives you a glimpse into why Athens is such a
          captivating place to visit!
