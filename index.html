              <em><b>Acropolis of Athens:</b></em> is one of the most iconic
              ancient landmarks in the world. Built in the 5th century BCE, it
              served as the religious and cultural heart of the city. The most
              famous structure on the Acropolis is the Parthenon, a temple
              dedicated to the goddess Athena. Today, the Acropolis stands as a
              powerful reminder of ancient Greek civilization, democracy, and
              architectural mastery.

              <em><b>Temple of Olympian Zeus</b></em
              >, also known as the Olympieion, is one of the largest ancient
              temples ever built in Greece. Construction began in the 6th
              century BCE but was not completed until the 2nd century CE under
              the Roman Emperor Hadrian. Dedicated to Zeus, the king of the
              gods, the temple once featured 104 massive Corinthian columns,
              though only a few remain standing today. Despite its ruined state,
              the sheer scale of the structure still inspires awe. The temple
              reflects the grandeur of both Greek and Roman influence and serves
              as a testament to Athens' rich architectural history.

              <em><b>The Panathenaic Stadium</b></em> is a historic marble
              stadium located in the heart of Athens, Greece. Originally built
              in the 4th century BCE for the Panathenaic Games, it was later
              rebuilt entirely in white marble by the Romans around 144 CE. It
              is the only stadium in the world made completely of marble. The
              stadium was revived in the 19th century and famously hosted the
              first modern Olympic Games in 1896. Today, it remains a symbol of
              Olympic heritage and classical architecture. Visitors can walk its
              track and stands, experiencing the grandeur of ancient and modern
              sports history in one place.
